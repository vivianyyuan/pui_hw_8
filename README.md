##Portfolio description:

My website is a portfolio about myself and some of the projects that I've done in the past. This would help me in the recruiting process to give recruiters concrete examples of my work and allow them to ask me questions about my work during an interview. I included a short bio of some of my experience and my interests on an about page so that I could give a more personal touch to my portfolio, and I coded out two project pages that describe some of my group projects and the design process from beginning to end. These projects are both group projects, but I am working on coding out the third project, which is mainly a solo project. What makes my portfolio interesting and engaging is my use of visual elements that are bold and really stand out. My target audience is anyone, but with a slight focus on recruiters in the UX design industry.

##How to navigate my portfolio website:

My website is pretty simple to use because there aren't too many interactive elements besides hovering and clicking on a few buttons to navigate around the website.

- Overall: You can hover and click on the vy. in the top left corner, and you can also click on the "work" and "about" links in the side navigation. You can also click on the arrows to scroll down the page to the first div element.
\
- Home/Works page: You can hover over basically every single element on the page to see a change in the colors. You can click on the arrow, and that will scroll down the page to display the projects. You can also click on project mockup image (it will take up essentially the whole page) to view that project.
\
- About page: You can hover over the huge text to have them animate to be skewed and fill with different colors. You can click on the "view my work" button that will lead to the first project mockup image on the home/works page
\
- Project pages: You can hover over the huge visual element at the top of the page, as well as the footer at the bottom to see different animations. You can click on the "jump to final prototype(s)" button to scroll all the way down to the prototypes for easier access to my final works. At the bottom, you can click on the footer links to navigate from project to project. I also have embedded Figma prototypes that you can interact with as well.

External libraries:

I used CSS animations to add more interesting elements to my portfolio. I decided on using animations because they were simpler but had a wide range of uses, and even the simplest animations added a lot of polish to the website. I used them for all of my hover states, and that included using opacity, grayscale filtering, and skewing the text. I think it adds to my website because my concept was to start with black/white and then when you hover over an element, it would become colorful, which feels dynamic and exciting. It also makes my portfolio feel more professional and clean overall. The only changes I made to my prototype were adding in more content, changing where the button on my project pages was, and making my social links as a footer at the bottom rather than on the side as part of the navigation bar.

Challenges:

The main challenges I experienced were figuring out how to rotate the navigation bar and making sure my layout was how I envisioned it to look in my prototype. I also had some trouble with aligning specific elements because they would often be off by a few pixels, but that was often because I had forgotten to put my content in a column.
