                    <h3>a little bit about <strong class="green">me.</strong></h3><br>
                    <p>My name is Vivian Yuan, and I am an undergraduate junior double majoring in Human-Computer Interaction
                        and Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University. I first heard about HCI and UI/UX Design 
                        in my freshman spring, and since then, I have started noticing so many things in my everyday life that 
                        could be improved with design, ranging from my school’s internal sites all the way to my toothpaste tubes. 
                        I love being able to work on and see transformations in digital products from ideation to development, 
                        and it is so fulfilling to be able to see the tangible effects of good design. I am amazed by how far 
                        we’ve progressed in the field, and I am excited to be a part of great things to come.<br><br>
                        
                        In my free time, I love to play games with my friends, whether it be tactical first-person shooter games 
                        like Valorant, or fast-paced strategy board games like One Night Werewolf. I also grew up singing in a choir 
                        and have continued to sing in a cappella groups since my freshman year of high school. I played the flute 
                        from fourth grade to senior year of high school, participating in different state and honors orchestras and 
                        bands throughout the years. UI/UX design is a perfect way for me to combine the critical thinking skills I 
                        gained from gaming with the creativity that I have nurtured since elementary school, and I am so glad to have 
                        found a field that I am passionate about.</p><br>
