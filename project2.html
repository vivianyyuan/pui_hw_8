                <h2 class="darkpink"><strong>introduction</strong></h2>
                <p>When I came back to Pittsburgh at the start of the school year, I noticed that there were scooters laying 
                    around various sidewalks. I had heard of Bird as a scooter rental service, but these scooters were new, 
                    with bright orange branding and the word “SPIN” on them. Naturally, when I was tasked to design a data 
                    dashboard for SPIN Scooters as a class group project, I thought it would be a cool experience as I had 
                    personally used one of the scooters myself.<br><br>
                    The project description itself was to work in a group of 3-4 students to iteratively design a dashboard 
                    that displays information about the scooters, focusing on the needs of 2 or more personas defined by the
                     professors. We were provided with spreadsheets of scooter data from various sources and 4 personas with
                      different goals and usages for the data dashboard.</p>

                <p>Given a set of personas and scooter data, we wanted to design a data dashboard that would create a pleasant 
                    experience for SPIN workers and allow them to efficiently make data-driven decisions. Our dashboard aimed 
                    to address the goals of two of the four personas.<br><br>
                    The 4 personas we were provided with were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mia: data analyst at SPIN living in NYC</li>

                        <li>Paula: accessibility and transit advocate</li>

                      Mia’s goals, dark pink for Kalen’s goals, yellow for Elliot’s goals, and red for Paula’s goals. We then 
                      grouped sticky notes underneath third-level broader goals to see what the personas had in common and 
                      grouped those goals under second-level dashboard functions, then finally top-level broadest dashboard

                    <ul>
                        <li>Map view: hover over a neighborhood to view scooter information useful for both Kalen and Mia</li>
                        <li>Historical data: Mia can analyze data based on past time ranges to see trends and generate business insights</li>
                        <li>Current scooter status map + scooter status filters: Kalen can see how many scooters of each type
                             require different services, Mia can understand scooter allocation</li>
                        <li>Route planning tool: Kalen can use this to see his optimal route based on either time or money</li>
                    </ul><br></p>
                <p>
                    We participated in an in-class critique where we received significant feedback to improve our prototype:

                <p>Having our most important features in place. we decided to build a micro design system with an expanded 
                    color palette to improve our data visualizations and overall increase aesthetics before our next iteration.<br><br>
                    For our first two iterations, we relied solely on SPIN’s brand colors, which were bright orange, white, and 
                    black/dark grey, and this limited the breadth of our data expression. By adding two sub-colors and having 
                    a different color for alerts, we expected that we would be able to improve our dashboard design and add more 
                    variety to the dashboard elements.<br><br>
                    We focused on having gradients for the scooter status filters, allowing Mia to generate higher-level 
                    insights by switching between statuses and allowing Kalen to understand which scooters need which service 
                    based on their status. We also implemented gradients in other data visualizations to improve aesthetics.

                     visualizations further, and adding animations and interactivity, helping Mia and Kalen interact better 
                     with the dashboard. Some of the most significant features we added were an alert function for the current
                      view, a date picker function for the historical view, and a visual redesign to incorporate our design

                <p>This was the first group project that I had done in Figma, and I thought it was challenging but rewarding. 
                    Some of my major takeaways were understanding how to utilize personas, gaining more proficiency in Figma, 
                    and gaining more design group work experience.

                        <li><span class="strongBody2">Personas inform and guide the design process.</span> 
                            Throughout this project, I found myself constantly considering whether or not Mia or Kalen would
                             benefit from certain data and functionalities, and I wanted to make sure that I found the
                              cross-section between their goals to maximize utility for both personas.</li>
                        <li><span class="strongBody2">Components improve work flow tremendously.</span> 
                            I had previous experience with components in Adobe XD, but for some reason, I could not figure out
                             how to use components in Figma. For our first few iterations, I was creating separate screens 
                             to demonstrate each animation, which was highly inefficient, so I learned how to use component 
                             variants and prototype within each component to organize my work better and reduce clutter in the
                            Figma file.</li>
                        <li><span class="strongBody2">Diversity within a team is essential.</span>
                            For this project, I worked with an undergraduate electrical and computer engineering major and a 
                            master student in human-computer interaction who had previous design work experience. We were able
                             to leverage our backgrounds to think more critically about what data and functions would be most 
                             useful and to create a more visually pleasing design.</li>
