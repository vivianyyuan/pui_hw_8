                <p>For this project, we selected a specific domain to focus on and created a responsive web design responding 
                    to a problem faced by users within that domain. Throughout the project, we conducted user research, 
                    created storyboards, and created low to high-fidelity prototypes, culminating in a pitch to Petfinder.</p>

                <p>The domain that we selected was adopting or fostering a pet. We chose this domain because we believed that 
                    our potential designs could be the most impactful and we would easily be able to interview users around us.</p>

                <p>To understand what our users’ pain points were, we interviewed 5 people who had adopted or fostered pets 
                    before and created an affinity diagram and customer journey map based on our interview findings. 
                    For our interviews, we utilized the directed storytelling method to allow us to understand the users’ 
                    lived experiences, and we created an interview guide with framing questions and semi-structured followup 
                    questions to allow us to gain the most information and clarify any of the points that the user brought up.</p>

                <p>After consolidating our research findings, we determined a few pain points:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The process of researching for different pets and organizations to adopt/foster from was difficult</li>
                        <li>The users felt that they did not receive enough information about the pet’s condition and how to 
                            take care of them after adoption</li>
                        <li>The users loved meeting with the pets when they were able to, but it wasn’t always a possibility 
                            due to lack of updated information from the shelter or the location of the shelters being too far away</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>We decided to address the <span class="strongBody1">information gap during the pre-adoption research process</span> by creating a virtual 
                    appointment scheduler for Petfinder, an established platform where users can look for available pets and their 
                    shelters online. The virtual scheduler allows users to see more effectively how the pet fits into their lives
                     without having to travel, and shelter can help a greater number of pets get adopted by connecting them with
                      more users.</p>

                <p>We started by creating mobile prototypes to focus on the information hierarchy and flow on a smaller screen.
                     Currently, Petfinder has a card on the pet profile page with a button that says “Introduce Yourself” which 
                     users can click on to send their information to the shelter that houses the pet. We wanted to create another
                      button on that card that would allow users to schedule either an in-person or virtual appointment and 
                      provide flexibility with the available times, as well as create a video chatting interface which would be 
                      housed on Petfinder to reduce the user’s potential technological constraints.</p>

                        <li>Remove “introduce yourself” button to make it easier to distinguish between button functions</li>
                        <li>Show shelter location during scheduling flow because it is an important factor</li>
                        <li>Create a confirmation page before the final appointment details screen</li>
                        <li>Small wording changes on the final appointment details screen</li>

                <p>We designed a mobile mid-fidelity prototype and incorporated the feedback. We wanted the function to blend in

                <p>I learned a lot about user research from this project, and I gained valuable experience from being able
                     to design for a specific domain and problem that arose from the research that I conducted.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="strongBody1">Rapid research methods provide quick and valuable insights.</span> 
                            I had never used directed storytelling before, so it was amazing to see how just a few interviews 
                            could lead to so many different findings and pain points that we never would have known about. 
                            Directed storytelling can easily get to the deeper reasons behind why users feel a certain way.</li>
                        <li><span class="strongBody1">Customer journey maps effectively synthesize user experiences.</span> 
                            This was my first time creating a customer journey map, and I found it very helpful in making sure 
                            that we had the users’ emotions, pain points, experiences, and improvement opportunities all in one 
                            place. This allowed us to easily focus on certain pain points to address in our design.</li>
                        <li><span class="strongBody1">Mobile-first design is useful when deciding initial layouts and features to include.</span>
                            This was my first time designing a high-fidelity interactive mobile prototype, and it was interesting
                             discussing with my group about how we should approach mobile design vs. desktop design as we had 
                             many discussions about the best way to lay out information and what features we should include based
                              on the medium that designed for.</li>
